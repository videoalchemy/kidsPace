###Process Prototypes:
This project is also an investigation into the software development process.  What are the 'best practices'?  Best way to document?  To track features?  To track releases?  To track bugs?  To log changes? To evolve software?  I've worked with two dev teams on two enterprise level software projects and in both cases, we were forced by breakdown and failure to invent and deploy reliable processes and procedures. Doing so was challenge. Retrofitting processes to full blown projects is just as difficult as changing the dev team culture:  so much inertial.  A small solo-project, however, is ideal for test-driving process prototypyes.      

####Process Tools:
#####git tags

#####specification by example (aka Executable Specs)

#####Behavior Driven Development
Start with a failing customer acceptance test that describes the behavior of the system from the customer's point of view.  Write this acceptance test in the form of an example of the way we want the system to behave in particular scenearios.  This will enable me to visualize the system before building it.
